## Getting started

To get started, add the package to your pubspec.yaml file:

`flutter pub add persistent_top_sheet`

Then, import the package into your Dart file:

`import 'package:persistent_top_sheet/persistent_top_sheet.dart';`


## Usage

First create the client with optional parameters
```dart
// if you want to use the controller, you can use open(), close() or toggle()
// otherwise you can drag the handle by default
final controller = PersistentTopSheetController();

PersistentTopSheet(
    maxHeight: 500,
    minHeight: 50,
    controller: controller,
    childBuilder: (currentHeight) => SheetBody(currentHeight: currentHeight),
    handleBuilder: (currentHeight) => const DragHandle(),
    onStateChanged: (state) => debugPrint('isOpen: $state'),
);
```

There is a ready-to-use example in the `/example` folder.
